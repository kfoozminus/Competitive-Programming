#### How to pick the perfect data structure

There are several aspect of data structures to consider when selecting the proper way to represent the data for a problem.

##### Will it work?

If the data struct won't work, it's not helpful at all. Ask yourself what questions the algorithm will need to be able to ask the data structure, and make sure the data structure can handle it. If not, then either more data must be added to the structure, or you need to find a different representation.

##### Can I code it?

If you don't know or can't remember how to code a given data structure, pick a different one. Make sure that you have a good idea how each of the operations will affect the structure of the data.

Another consideration here is memory. Will the data structure fit in the available memory? If not, compact it or pick a new one. Otherwise, it is already clear from the beginning that it won't work.

##### Can I Code It In Time?

As this is a timed contest, you have three to five programs to write in five hours. If it'll take you an hour and a half to code just the data structure for the first problem, then you're almost certainly looking at the wrong structure.

##### Can I Debug It?

It is easy to forget this particular aspect of data structure selection. Remember that a program is useless unless it works. Don't forget that debugging time is a large portion of the contest time, so include its consideration in calculating coding time.

What makes a data structure easy to debug? That is basically determined by the following two properties.

* **State Is Easy To Examine** The smaller, more compact the representation, in general, the easier it is to examine. Also, statically allocated arrays are **much** easier to examine than linked lists or even dynamically allocated arrays.
* **State can Be Displayed Easily** For the more complex data structures, the easiest way to examine them is to write a small routine to output the data. Unfortunately, given time constraints, you'll probably want to limit yourself to text output. This means that structures like trees and graphs are going to be difficult to examine.

##### Is It Fast?

This is, surprisingly, the least important consideration when picking a data structure. A slow program will normally get a noticeable portion of the points, but a fast, incorrect one will not, unless it gets lucky.

##### Conclusion

In general, remember the KISS principle: ``Keep It Simple, Stupid.'' Sometimes more complexity is very helpful, but make sure you're getting your money's worth. Remember that taking the time to make sure you've got the correct data structure at the start is a lot less expensive than having to replace a data structure later.

#### Things to Avoid: Dynamic Memory

In general, you should avoid dynamic memory, because:

**It Is Too Easy To Make Mistakes Using Dynamic Memory**

Overwriting past allocated memory, not freeing memory, and not allocating memory are only some of the mistakes that are introduced when dynamic memory is used. In addition, the failure modes for these errors are such that it's hard to tell where the error occurred, as it's likely to be at a (potentially much later) memory operation.

**It Is Too Hard To Examine the Data Structure's Contents**

The interactive development environments available don't handle dynamic memory well, especially for C.

Consider parallel arrays as an alternative to dynamic memory. One way to do a linked list, where instead of keeping a next point, you keep a second array, which has the index of the next element. Sometimes you may have to dynamically allocate these, but as it should only be done once, it's much easier to get right than allocating and freeing the memory for each insert and delete.

All of this notwithstanding, sometimes dynamic memory is the way to go, especially for large data structures where the size of the structure is not known until you have the input.

####  Things to Avoid: Coolness Factor

Try not to fall into the ``coolness'' trap. You may have just seen the neatest data structure, but remember:

* **Cool ideas that don't work aren't. **
* **Cool ideas that'll take forever to code aren't, either**

It's much more important that your data structure and program work than how impressive your data structure is.

#### Basic Structures

There are five basic data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and deque (pronounced deck). You might have seen these structures before. If you have not, consult Sedgewick for what they are.

##### Binary Search Trees

Binary search trees enable you to search a collection of objects (each with a real or integer value) quickly to determine if a given value exists in the collection.

Basically, a binary search tree is a weighted, rooted binary ordered tree. That collection of adjectives means that each node in the tree might have one `right' child and one `left' child (but both or either could be missing). In addition, each node has an object associated with it, and the `weight' of the node is the value of the object.

The binary search tree also has the property that each node's left child and descendants of its left child have a value less than that of the node, and each node's right child and its descendants have a value greater or equal to it.

The nodes are generally represented as a structure with four fields, a pointer to the node's left child, a pointer to the node's right child, the weight of the object stored at this node, and a pointer to the object itself.

##### Why Are Binary Search Trees Useful?

Given a collection of N objects, a binary search tree takes only O(log N) time to find an objects, assuming that the tree is not really poor (a tree where each node has no left child means the search will take O(N) time, for example). In addition, unlike just keeping a sorted array, inserting and deleting objects only takes log N time as well.

##### Variations on Binary Trees

Sometimes it's helpful to provide a link to a node's parent as well.

There are several variants that ensure that the trees are never poor. Splay trees, Red-black trees, Treaps, B-trees, and AVL trees are some of the more common examples. They are all much more complicated to code, and random trees are generally good, so it's generally not worth it.

If you're concerned that the tree you created might be bad (it's being created by inserting elements from an input file, for example), then randomly order the elements before insertion.

##### Hash Tables

A hash table stores data with a very quick way to do lookups. Let's say there is a collection of objects and a data structure must quickly answer the question: ``Is this object in the data structure?'' (e.g., is this word in the dictionary?). A hash table does this in less time than it takes to do binary search.

The idea is this: find a function that maps the elements of the collection to an integer between 1 and x (where x, in this explanation, is larger than the number of elements in your collection). Keep an array indexed from 1 to x, and store each element at the position that the function evaluates the element as. Then, to determine if something is in your collection, just plug it into the function and see whether or not that position is empty. If it is not check the element there to see if it is the same as the something you're holding,

For example, presume the function is defined over 3-character words, and is (first letter + (second letter * 3) + (third letter * 7)) mod 11 (A=1, B=2, etc.), and the words are ``CAT'', ``CAR'', and ``COB''. When using ASCII, this function takes ``CAT'' and maps it to 3, maps ``CAR'' to 0, and maps ``COB'' to 7, so the hash table would look like this:   
`   
0: CAR  
1  
2  
3: CAT  
4  
5  
6  
7: COB  
8  
9  
10  
`

Now, to see if ``BAT'' is in the table, plug it into the hash function to get 2. This position in the hash table is empty, so it is not in the collection. ``ACT'', on the other hand, returns the value 7, so the program must check to see if that entry, ``COB'', is the same as ``ACT''.

Consider this function:

    #define NHASH 8999           /* make sure this is prime! */

    hashnum(p)
    char *p;
    {
        unsigned int sum = 0;
        for ( ; *p; p++)
    	sum = (sum

    This function will return *some* integer in the range 0..NHASH-1 for
    every input.  As it turns out, the output is fairly random.  this simple
    function for NHASH to be prime.  Combine the above with a main program:

    #include

    main() {
        FILE *in;
        char line[100], *p;
        in = fopen ("/usr/share/dict/words", "r");
        while (fgets (line, 100, in)) {
    	for (p = line; *p; p++)
    	    if (*p == 'n') { *p = '
